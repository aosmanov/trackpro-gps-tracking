CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO TRACKPRO APP:

Method 1 - Expo Go Manual Connection:
1. Open Expo Go on your phone
2. Enter this URL manually: exp://172.22.183.62:8081
3. Or try: exp://172.22.183.62:19000

Method 2 - Alternative Setup:
Since WSL networking is causing issues, try this:

1. Install the Expo Go app on your phone
2. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
3. Find your computer's IP address on the network:
   - Windows: Open cmd, type: ipconfig
   - Look for "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" IPv4 Address
4. Use that IP instead of localhost

Or we can test the web version first:
- The mobile app code should work in browser at localhost:8081
